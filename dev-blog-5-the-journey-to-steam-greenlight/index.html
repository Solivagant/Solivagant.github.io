            <p>I bring you fantastic, joyful news. <strong>Gunkatana</strong> has been <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=637591816"><strong>Greenlit</strong> on <strong>Steam</strong></a> after less than two weeks!</p>

<p>I am ecstatic. Everyone on the team is really happy. But there's more!</p>

<p>In the past day, more than <strong>700 people</strong> have downloaded the <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/gunkatana/133872">pre-alpha build from <strong>GameJolt</strong></a>, after we landed on the first page as a <strong>GameJolt featured</strong> game!</p>

<p>From that, we've already spotted two <strong>Youtuber</strong> Let's Play videos of Gunkatana:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/maNcEH_LmPI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><strong>MegaGWolf's</strong> take on the game is very positive and wonderful to hear. Watching as he discovers the mechanics of the game and really gets a blast of fun out of it, it's the reason we are doing this in the first place! BTW it was his idea to show that particular cyborg ninja on the thumbnail :p</p>

<p>I'm making a note here: I'm really <strong>happy about this</strong>!</p>

<p>And then we have <strong>l'academie du noob</strong>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-DwbE3zTfI">gameplay video</a> in French. His feedback is also very positive, and points out all the things we know we must improve: better AI, and more modes, levels - it's all in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Very soon we are going to be launching a <strong>Kickstarter</strong> campaign. We've been preparing it for the past few months, and we've got a wealth of things to show that we haven't yet.</p>

<p>The <strong>pre-alpha build</strong>; getting on <strong>Steam Greenlight</strong>; they were our initial move - let's get this out there and see what happens.</p>

<p>With Gunkatana already <strong>Greenlit</strong> going into the <strong>Kickstarter</strong> and extremely positive feedback from players, we are very confident, but we need your help!</p>

<p>We've done a ton of work on <strong>Gunkatana</strong>'s official website - I'm incredibly proud of the work <strong>João Nascimento</strong> (not my brother, but one of my best friends!) has put into making our home on the web a place filled with all the information you need.</p>

<p>Check it out here: <a href="http://gunkatana.com">www.gunkatana.com</a> </p>

<p>Sign up there to get the latest updates on <strong>Gunkatana</strong>. If you like what you're seeing, we hope you'll like what's coming next!</p>

<p>I have to give a shoutout to all the members of <strong>Team Gunkatana</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CrazyArcadia</strong> - for his continuous hard work on making the best pixel art, coming up with game design ideas off the cuff and discussing them on the fly, making the gorgeous <strong>THANK YOU GREENLIGHT COMMUNITY</strong> artwork we have posted everywhere now, and for being a <strong>freakin' BADASS</strong> - he made the city landscape flyover animation you see on the trailer in an incredibly short time!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>João Nascimento</strong> - for crafting a fantastic website - and updating it on the fly, being available at all times, hitting us with his own perspective on the game, being someone me and everyone else on the team can always count on, his behind-the-scenes work on getting all the stuff we've shown so far - like getting all the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=637591816">Steam Greenlight</a>, <a href="https://torn-page.itch.io/gunkatana">itch.io</a>, <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/gunkatana">IndieDB</a> pages ready and helping out with the forum posts, and for being The Wrath!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sarah Schemske</strong> - for creating with us a wonderful cyberpunk world we are very eager to explore, for adding depth to the story and triple-checking all the text we put out there (and for correcting the grammar!), and for coming up with fantastic ideas we can't wait to tell you about! You should read her atmospheric short stories set in the world of Gunkatana <a href="http://gunkatana.com/chronicles.html">at our site</a>!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I thank <strong>Joonas Turner</strong> and <strong>Niilo Takalainen</strong> for the brutal sound design we have on the pre-alpha build already. Can't wait to get them to make more crunchy sounds! A big thanks also to <strong>Miriam Grohmann</strong> for creating the trailer after me and <strong>João</strong> tried our hand at it - and ending up in pain (Adobe Premiere is much harder than we tought)!</p>

<p>I have to thank <strong>Electric Cafe</strong> as well for the retrowave pumping music they keep making for the game.</p>

<p>You can check out a sample here:  </p>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/251325722&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<p>You haven't seen any of <strong>Marco Machado</strong>'s art for the game yet, but you won't have to wait much longer. Really looking forward to unleashing it all on you very soon!</p>

<p>Thank you all for your support and look out for our <strong>Kickstarter</strong> coming soon!</p>
