            <p>Intel and BeMyApp hosted the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/event/buzzworkshop">Intel Buzz Workshop</a> event on December 8th, where a cadre of games industry experts gave talks and panels on a number of really interesting subjects, like game design, how to make your own game engine and VR.</p>

<p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:2368/content/images/2015/12/Solivagant_2015-Dec-08-1.jpg" alt="Strong beard showing at the panel" style="width: 600px;  display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>I really enjoyed The Future of Indie Games panel hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/oh_cripes">Joe Bain</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/attilioHimeki">Attilio Carotenuto</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/usefulslug">Vegard Myklebust</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gormlai">Gorm Lai</a>, all great, proficient game devs and friends I’ve met in the London indie dev community.</p>

<p>My biggest takeaway was Gorm’s insistence: <strong>“polish, polish, polish!”</strong>. </p>

<p>I definitely agree, it’s what I’m working on with <strong>Gunkatana</strong>, polishing the hell out of it.</p>

<p>The event had a special <strong>Developer Showcase</strong>, a challenge open to any indie developers, studios or students. I submitted <strong>Gunkatana</strong> and was thankfully accepted to the participate, along with 7 other games.</p>

<p>My day consisted of manning the Gunkatana table, explaining the game to attendees.</p>

<p>The joy in seeing someone pick the game up and really quickly <em>get it</em>, understand what it’s all about and join in the banter, this is the reason why I’ve quit my previous job and gone <strong>full time</strong>.</p>

<p>Seeing someone take real fun from something I’ve built and designed is an <em>incredible happy feeling</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:2368/content/images/2015/12/BeMyAppUK_2015-Dec-08-1.jpg" alt="Early Speed Rails" style="width: 480px;  display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <br>
The <strong>Developer Showcase</strong> urged attendees to vote on the Best Game of the Show, and <strong>Gunkatana won!</strong></p>

<p>This marks the first award Gunkatana has received, and I’m pretty sure it won’t be the last!</p>

<p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:2368/content/images/2015/12/Solivagant_2015-Dec-08.jpg" alt="Early Speed Rails" style="width: 480px;  display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>People really enjoyed playing it and picked up on the text we’ve placed on the game when you kill someone: <em>“Selfie Kill”</em>, <em>“Rail Kill”</em>, <em>“SWIPED!”</em>, and some would even say it out loud. The same happened at GameCity!</p>

<p>Some of the expressions and words people told me throughout the day:</p>

<p><strong>“this is amazing” 
“this is so cool” 
“it feels really good” 
“controls very well” 
“satisfying to kill the other characters”</strong></p>

<p>I turned on the very <strong>prototypical</strong> AI bots on some occasions, and players would keep killing them and enjoying that interaction, despite the AI bots still being a bit embrionary and not being able to use all the weapons.</p>

<p>Gunkatana is a very fast paced action game that features a number of very quick game mechanics. Once you get what makes it tick, you can quickly <strong>zip around the arena</strong> and destroy your enemies, making cool <strong>reflected laser</strong> kills and <strong>running</strong> them over!</p>

<p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:2368/content/images/2015/12/Turbo.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m so used to the game that I kept accidentally slaying the other players without even realising, so by the end of the day I just watched people play rather than join in.</p>

<p>One of the many takeaways I got is that there’s room to introduce the mechanics piece by piece so that players get used to them. That isn’t very easy to do on a pure local multiplayer game, which gives me more fuel to develop the <strong>single player / co-op campaign</strong>.</p>

<p>I also want to give players a good package of fun, since the game feel and mechanics are so enjoyable, I want to give them a chance to practice their skills.</p>

<p>It was also the first time that I had people try out the new respawning feature, and despite a bug here and there, it worked pretty well, and players understood <strong>they could choose where and when to respawn</strong>.</p>

<p>One suggestion I took to heart to <strong>signal a character's death</strong> more, so they're aware they  have died. Which means researching other games to figure out how best to do it, besides, you know, splattering the corpse all over the place.</p>

<p>It was a fantastic day, as all days that I have shown the game at an event are, really!</p>

<p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:2368/content/images/2015/12/Explosion.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>We’re now preparing to put the game on <strong>Greenlight</strong>, and hoping to <strong>release the game early next year</strong>.</p>
